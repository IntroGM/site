In other words, how bad do things get when we only estimate temperatures at distant points? For this exercise, you can use either your existing solution to the 1D heat advection-diffusion equation or the code in the cell below.\n",

    "    2. Steady-state heat conduction with heat production, but no advection\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. Implement the calculation of the analytical solutions (true values) at the end of the code just above the plotting so that the true values are calculated at the same spatial locations $x$ as the finite difference calculations. You can set things up so that you calculate `Tss_adv` for the advection case and `Tss_hp` for the heat production case.\n",
    "3. Add the necessary code to be able to plot either one of the analytical solutions with the finite difference solution.\n",
    "4. Since we are comparing against steady-state solutions, we need to be sure that our model has reached a thermal steady state. We can estimate the time needed to reach a conductive steady state using the characteristic timescale for diffusion $\\tau$\n",

    "- Although it is possible to perform step 5 directly in NumPy and without a for loop, you are advised to use a for loop for calculating the percent error.\n",

Specifically, larger distances between points tends to increase error. We have also been [introduced](https://introgm.github.io/2020/day-2/stability.html) to problems with the **stability** of our solutions. As a reminder, the stability of a solution refers to whether or not a small change in the parameters of the system results in unstable growth of errors. For problems involving time, a stable solution should either show a decrease in error with time or errors that do not change with time. An unstable solution will show growth of errors with time that do not become bounded, and often grow larger over time.\n",

For example, it is common to use the calculation of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (or CFL) condition in problems that involve advection. The CFL condition states that the distance material is advected should not exceed the distance between points in the solution grid. In mathematical terms, the CFL condition is\n",
