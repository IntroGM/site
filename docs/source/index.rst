   Interactions of erosion and deformation in a geodynamic model.

Course goals
------------

- Understand the fundamental physical equations solved in numerical geodynamic models, how they work, and how they affect numerical experiments
- Learn how to convert the main equations used to model lithospheric deformation into simple programs
- Develop a background understanding of geodynamics that allows you to properly understand the behavior of geodynamic numerical models
