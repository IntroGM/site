    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "ASPECT (Kronbichler et al., 2012 and Heister et al., 2017) is a modern and versatile geodynamic modeling software, which is intended to be run on multiple processor cores parallelly. Another design guideline has been gentle learning curve, to enable geoscientists with little scientific computing experience to set up and run geologically meaningful models. The abbreviation ASPECT comes from **A**dvanced **S**olver for **P**lanetary **E**volution, **C**onvection, and **T**ectonics, giving a pledge to perform physical modeling of variety of geological processes inside the solid Earth or other rocky planets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, ASPECT solves physical quantities of a thermo-mechanical system in 2D or 3D domain, by employing finite element method (FEM). The full documentation of ASPECT can be found [here](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",

    "ASPECT calculates the flow velocity (the magnitude and the direction) and pressure by solving the Stokes equation for highly viscous material, i.e. solid rock and slowly flowing rock melts\n",

    "where $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\\varepsilon$ is the strain rate, $\\mathbf u=\\mathbf u(\\mathbf x \\subseteq \\Omega,t)$ is the velocity field, $p=p(\\mathbf x \\subseteq \\Omega,t)$ the pressure field, $\\rho$ is the density and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

    "The dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ in the equation (1) is exponentially dependent on the temperature, so equations (1), (2) and (3) are solved in coupled manner. The physical properties of the model materials, such as density, viscosity and radioactive heat production, are carried by compositional fields, which are advected due to velocity field. \n",
