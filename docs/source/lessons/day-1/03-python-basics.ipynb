    "# Basic elements of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "These Python lessons provide an overview of some of the basic elements in the Python programming language. In the first set they include how to define and use variables, the concept of a data type, and how to determine the data type of a variable in Python, and Python lists. Later parts of the lessons introduce the [NumPy numerical Python library](http://www.numpy.org/), and the main conceptual programming components we will use: functions, loops, and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction, but rather something to give you enough background to be able to work on the programming assignments later in this course. For more about basic Python programming we refer you to the {doc}`../../course-info/resources` page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources\n",
    "\n",

    "This is a Jupyter Notebook, with content designed to cover the basic concepts of programming in Python. The contents of this document are divided into cells, which can contain Markdown-formatted text, Python code, or raw text. You can execute code in a cell by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. Try this out in the examples below."
