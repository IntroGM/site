# Learning goals

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Solve partial differential equations using the finite-difference method
- Differentiate between and implement various boundary and initial conditions in numerical geodynamic models
- Create their own 1D geodynamic models and know how to use modern 3D numerical geodynamic modelling software to simulate common physical processes in the Earth (heat transfer, rock deformation, etc.)
